Welcome to madlib.py

Madlibs is a fun game where players contribute words within certain word types
such as adjective, verb, noun, and proper noun, or even types of things such
as an animal, a piece of furniture, or a vehicle. These words are then used to
replace others of the same type, in a phrase or paragraph. The results are
usually entertaining.
